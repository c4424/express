# **Instructions**

### Part 1
* Spend a few moments looking over the code sent to you. First, get the server running, then begin to dissect the JavaScript code found at the bottom of `add.html`.

* Explain to one another what the code does, what its for, and why its relevant to the application so far. Be sure to explain to one another what the `fetch` code is doing.

* Add an html file to your app and create a route to handle that file.
* Be creative

### Part 2

* Push the finished Star Wars app to heroku following the steps from the guide.

* BONUS: Begin making the below additional page for your Star Wars app. Push those changes up as you build the new feature. Specifically, this will require:

* Create a new page on your Star Wars website that displays a table of ALL characters in the database. This will involve at minimum:
* Creating a route in the server.js file for displaying data
* Creating a route in the server.js file for sending users a new HTML file
* Creating an HTML file that grabs data from the server.
